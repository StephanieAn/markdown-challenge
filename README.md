You have a sad feeling or demotivation time, I can cheer you up and motivate you.

A funny story
--------------
During my baccalaureate, some of my friends made me a funny song because I broke a chair and fell on the floor. After that, every time we had class in that audience, they sang me "my" song. 

#### TL;DR
My friends made me a song after I've broken a chair in an audience.
